"""
Single synaptic input.

This script illustrates how to create a synapse and connect it to one
single dendritic section. This synapse then delivers a train of
excitatory (glutamatergic) inputs and the voltage (i.e. the excitatory
post-synaptic potential) at the soma is recorded.

Three simulations take place as the synapse is connected to a dendrite
close to the soma, then to another dendrite further from the soma, and
finally to a third dendrite even further away. The resulting
post-synaptic potentials are plotted together for comparison: the
further from the soma the wider the potential, similar to Figure 2(a)
and 2(b) in Lindroos and Hellgren Kotaleski (2021).

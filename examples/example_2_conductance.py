"""
Effects of channel conductance on cell excitability.

This script illustrates how to build a MSN and use that model to study
the effects of ion conductances on cell excitability.

A MSN is created and a current step is applied to its soma to stimulate
the cell. Then, a potassium conductance (kaf) is increased before
repeating the stimulation protocol. Both simulations are plotted to
compare the effect of `kaf` on cell activity.

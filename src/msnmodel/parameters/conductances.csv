# Values of maximal conductance (gbar) or permeability (pbar, for
# calcium mechanisms) for the MSN model in Lindroos2020.
#
# This table brings together two sources of values from the original
# Lindroos model: (1) the files `params_iMSN.json` and
# `params_dMSN.json`, and (2) default values for both iMSN and dMSN
# hardcoded in the class MSN in file MSN_builder.py. A commented-out
# line was added below to visually separate these two data sources.
#
# Columns:
#   cell <string>: 'imsn' | 'dmsn' | 'all'
#   mechanism <string>: 'naf', 'bk', etc.
#   compartment <string>: 'all' | 'soma' | 'dend' | 'axon'
#   value <numeric>: Value of gmax (or pmax for calcium)

# Model of a striatial medium spiny neuron (MSN)

These NMODL (.mod) files implement the biophysical mechanisms used for
modelling a MSN in NEURON as described in Lindroos & Hellgren
Kotaleski (2020). The original files are available from ModelDB [(model
266775)](http://modeldb.yale.edu/266775) (accessed 11 Feb 2021).

The code has been refactored by [Antonio
Gonz√°lez](mailto:antgon@cantab.net) with the help of The NEURON Book
(Carnevale & Hines 2006).
